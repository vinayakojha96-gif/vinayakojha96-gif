# Hi there 👋 I'm Vinayak Ojha (He/Him) — Software Engineer  
_Software Engineer · A Productive, Practical, and Passionate Builder_

🔭 I’m currently a Sr. Software Engineer at Celebal Technologies, working on GenAI RAG bots projects.  
🌱 I’m learning and iterating on practical GenAI and mlOps patterns for production-ready retrieval-augmented systems.  
👯 I’m open to collaborating on open-source projects and developer tooling.  
💬 Ask me about: backend systems, debugging, CI/CD, mlOps, and production architecture.  
⚡ Fun fact: By education I’m a Mechanical Engineer; by profession I’m a Software Developer — I enjoy solving common problems, especially debugging tricky issues.
